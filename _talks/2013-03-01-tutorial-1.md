A three part system consisting a JPEG based Image compression & transmission system, a H.264 (MPEG-4 AVC) based Video compression & transmission system and an Improved hybrid video codec. : Discrete cosine transformation (DCT), Quantization, Huffman entropy coding, Run length coding, ZigZag coding, IDCT, Motion vector aclculation, Motion & Residue Estimation, Quality Analysis techniques are implemented in the system and the freedom to choose any level of quantization and matrix quantization is also provided through user input.
