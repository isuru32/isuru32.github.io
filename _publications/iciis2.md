title: "Fetal Movement Identification Using Spectrograms with Attention Aided Models and Identifying a Set of Correlating Parameters with Gestational Age"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/iciis2
excerpt: 'Monitoring fetal movement is crucial for ensuring a fetus' safety. A well-known way of assessing fetus health involves regularly counting kicks and tracking the pattern. This procedure can be carried out either at home or in a clinical setting, but both has drawbacks like limited precision and irregular access to equipment. In order to identify fetal movements from such recordings, algorithms that can be employed in a home context to record fetal movements are taken into consideration. Attention mechanisms have shown the ability to better identify long term series events and the possibility of better identifying fetal movement occurrence using such models has been discussed in this paper as a novel use case and a novel attempt to correlate statistical parameters with the gestational age has also been discussed so that a fetus with irregularities of a fetus such as, decreased growth, can be identified beforehand.'
