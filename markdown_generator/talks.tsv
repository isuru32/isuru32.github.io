Smart Monitoring for Biomedical Applications    	fyp					The final research project focuses on using Biomedical Signal Processing techniques to monitor the wellbeing of pregnant mothers and their unborn fetuses. We improved an in-house developed fetal movement monitoring device, by expanding it to use multiple accelerometric sensors to measure the movements and vibrations of a pregnant motherâ€™s abdomen. This project is being conducted as a joint effort of the Faculty of Engineering and the Faculty of Medicine of the University of Peradeniya and consists of a large and diversified research team. This research experience was invaluable not only in terms of better grasping the subject matter but also in learning how to function in an interdisciplinary research team. Technologies: Python, Numpy, TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch, Scipy, pandas, Matplotlib, OpenCV, scikit-learn, Raspberry Pi, EAGLE
