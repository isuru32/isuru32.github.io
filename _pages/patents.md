* **Technical Problem:** Fetal movement measuring methods can be classified into two basic groups, active and passive. The active method includes high-frequency waves like ultrasound waves to detect fetal movements. Currently used active methods, Ultrasound and MRI scans, are expensive to perform and they should be performed in a clinical environment as well. Furthermore, the subjects should not be allowed to be exposed to these high-frequency waves for a long period of time. Comparatively the passive methods measure the fetal vibration incident on the maternal abdomen which is noninvasive. But up to now, prevalent passive devices cannot effectively distinguish maternal movements from fetal activity and also those technologies have not come to a level that has been widespread home-usage. The use of a single sensory device can deliver expected exposure and knowledge about fetal movements which can be further used for analysis. However, having data only from a single sensor could shadow some important information and such losses of data could potentially decrease the accuracy of the algorithmic solutions developed for the detections.

* **Technical Solution:** As the fetal movement patterns are a measurement of fetal well-being, it is important to ascertain fetal movements to avoid fetal morbidity and death and accelerometer data acquired from pregnant mothers are analyzed to recognize the fetal movement patterns. Using a multi-sensory device to record the above-mentioned signal patterns instead of a single sensor helps to capture a wide variety of data, which eventually helps to increase the output accuracy of the algorithms. This also allows us to identify the features which are more important and create a weighted distribution when considering these data as inputs to the software models. Identification of fetal movements from the accelerometer data is difficult due to the presence of the mother’s respiratory movements and mothers’ laugh signals in the data. Hence, time-domain analysis was utilized to separate fetal movements from the data. Therefore, clear recordings and multi sensory readings which can be taken even from a non-clinical environment is important and that is provided by
this device.
