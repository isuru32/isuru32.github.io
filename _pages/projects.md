<!-- ## AI4COVID (Ongoing)

* **Description:** The final year research project focuses on using Biomedical Signal Processing techniques to monitor the wellbeing of pregnant mothers and their unborn fetuses. We improved an in-house developed fetal movement monitoring device, by expanding it to use multiple accelerometric sensors to measure the movements and vibrations of a pregnant mother’s abdomen. This project is being conducted as a joint effort of the Faculty of Engineering and the Faculty of Medicine of the University of Peradeniya and consists of a large and diversified research team. This research experience was invaluable not only in terms of better grasping the subject matter but also in learning how to function in an interdisciplinary research team. 

* **Technologies:** Python, Numpy, TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch, Scipy, pandas, Matplotlib, OpenCV, scikit-learn, Raspberry Pi, EAGLE

* **Techniques:** Data collection & dataset generation, Short-time Fourier transform, Wavelet transform,
Spectrograms, PCA, LLE, Isomaps, ICA, LDA, Dense Nets, CNNs, Attention Nets, Transformers, GRU, LSTM -->

## Network Quality of Service Monitoring (NQoSM) (Internship Project)

* **Description:** The Network Quality of Service Monitoring (NQoSM) project is based on Linux systems and this system is targeted at creating a module which can identify the system bottlenecks, stress test a system against various processes of choice, use the monitoring tools inside the module to gather information about the system states and other statistical information, conduct experiments for different scenarios, visualize the gathered information and come into conclusions about the system bottlenecks and system performance under heavy loads. This module provides solutions to questions such as, which process is taking the most resources, how long can we run this particular process under this much of resource limitations etc. The monitoring module was one of the most important modules in the whole system and all the monitoring of the four types of resources are done using this module. This is responsible for collecting the system, performance, events data and storing it in convenient file formats. These are invoked at both Client End, Server Ends. We might want to trace and monitor different types of events inside a system. System calls, Linux kernel function calls, Userspace function calls, Custom “events” that you’ve defined either in userspace or in the kernel are some of them.
