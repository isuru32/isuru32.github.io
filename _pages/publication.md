<!-- * **Description:** Monitoring fetal movement is crucial for ensuring fetus's safety. A well-known way of assessing fetus health involves regularly counting kicks and tracking the pattern. This procedure can be carried out either at home or in a clinical setting, but both has drawbacks like limited precision and irregular access to equipment. In order to identify fetal movements from such recordings, algorithms that can be employed in a home context to record fetal movements are taken into consideration. Attention mechanisms have shown the ability to better identify long term series events and the possibility of better identifying fetal movement occurrence using such models has been discussed in this paper as a novel use case and a novel attempt to correlate statistical parameters with the gestational age has also been discussed so that a fetus with irregularities of a fetus such as, decreased growth, can be identified beforehand. -->

## Integrated Video Based Crowdedness Forecasting Framework with a Review of Crowd Counting Models [2021]

<!-- * **Description:** The goal was to put out a comprehensive system to automate crowd monitoring, gather information on crowd size, and forecast crowd size for both the immediate and foreseeable futures. CCTV footage was used to achieve this because it is easy to get them worldwide and they are excellent for analyzing crowd behavior. In this work, we used a dataset of our own to evaluate some of the best performing state-of-the-art algorithms that have been trained on big datasets for large crowd counting. The predicting of the crowd size at a certain site is the main topic of the second half of this paper. This was done in two situations: forecasting the level of crowding at any given time and date, and predicting the level of crowding over the course of the next 15 hours. -->
